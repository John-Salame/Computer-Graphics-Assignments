# Homework 6: Textures

## Textures
I created some textures in GIMP. I have a few textures for snow to try out, which are all slightly different. Currently, only snow.bmp and snow3.bmp are in use.  
I did not put textures on the main part of the candy cane because it looked awful on top of the glossy look of the candy cane. My idea was to add the illusion of depth, but that is not possible unless the candy cane can lose its shine on the damaged parts or machine cut marks. This is not possible with lighting settings that are uniform across the candy cane like I currently have.  
Press T to toggle textures.

## Day and Night
Scene 0 features a day and night cycle. Let it run on its own, or press C or O to control the sun/moon.

## Scenes
I have 3 scenes. Scene 0 is my main scene with lots of things in it. Scenes 1 and 2 have individual objects with a light orbiting them.  
Change the scene by holding CTRL and using the arrow keys. Press M to change projections (you can even walk around in first-person if you press M twice). Please read the controls for other functions, such as pausing the light or moving the light.

## Controls
* Press P to pause the light's motion and look around with the arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT). Please note that "Pause" and "Control Light" are mutually exclusive; enabling one will disable the other.
* Press C or 'o' to enter "Control Light" mode. In this mode, the light will pause and you can move the light with the arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT).
* Press CTRL + Arrow Keys to change the scene.
* Press L to enable or disable lighting.
* Press X to toggle axes.
* Press M (M for mode) to change from Orthogonal to Perspective to First Person.
* Press 0 (zero) to reset the scene.
* First-Person Perspective: Move with WASD (W=forward, A=left, S=down, D=right).
* First-Person Perspective: Turn the camera with the arrow keys.
* Overhead Orthogonal or Overhead Perspective: Spin the scene with the arrow keys.

## Time taken
I estimate that assignment 6 took 5 to 6 hours to complete. The most frustrating part was the grass texture, which was a ridiculously large image when I brought it in and I had trouble cropping it and scaling it to what I want. It doesn't look very good in the daytime, but it looks ok at night.
