## Blizzard
I did not have time to figure out fog using transparency + shaders. However, I did create a blizzard overlay. Press B to toggle the blizzard. The snow is more frenzied during they day than during the night.

## Normal Map Generator
I created a tool, createNormalMap.py, which creates OK to decent normal maps based on the textures I've created. So far it only creates variations in the tangent part of the normal vector (red). The bitangent (green) is always 128 (which means there is 0 bitangent component to the generated normal vector). I could extend my Python script to create the variations in the bitangent, but that would be a lot of headache adapting my red script to work for the y dimension and the green color.

## Normal Maps
The main feature of the final project is normal maps.
According to my README, I spent anywhere from 32 to 42 hours getting my normal maps to work.  
(Notes on a bug I fixed): The normal maps are a bit weird. It seems to be a moving illusion that changes from bumps to pits depending on which side the light is on. The shadows are always on the correct side, so I think it was just imbalance in the normals my createNormalMap.py generated. (End of notes on Python script bug)  
After fixing the bug in my Python script (in Final Project version 8), the normal maps look crisp and correct. However, the correct normal maps look too rigid for snow, so I decided to continue using snow normal maps generated by the bugged Python script for that wonky melty feel.

## Textures
I created some textures in GIMP. I have a few textures for snow to try out, which are all slightly different. I have three snow textures (two are in use), a grass texture which I cropped out of a texture I found (but forgot to cite the source and no longer remember it). I also have a "scratches" sort of texture that I use on the candy canes and the wooden bench seat. 
Press T to toggle textures.

## Day and Night
Scene 0 features a day and night cycle. Let it run on its own, or press C or O (the letter) to control the sun/moon.

## Scenes
I have 4 scenes. Scene 0 is my main scene with lots of things in it. Scenes 1 through 3 have individual objects with a light orbiting them.  
Change the scene by holding CTRL and using the arrow keys. Press M to change projections (you can even walk around in first-person if you press M twice). Please read the controls for other functions, such as pausing the light or moving the light.

## Controls
* Press P to pause the light's motion and look around with the arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT). Please note that "Pause" and "Control Light" are mutually exclusive; enabling one will disable the other.
* Press C or 'o' to enter "Control Light" mode. In this mode, the light will pause and you can move the light with the arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT).
* Press CTRL + Arrow Keys to change the scene.
* Press B to toggle the blizzard.
* Press L to enable or disable lighting. (does not work for objects with shaders)
* Press T to toggle textures. (does not work for objects with shaders)
* Press X to toggle axes.
* Press M (M for mode) to change from Orthogonal to Perspective to First Person.
* Press 0 (zero) to reset the scene.
* First-Person Perspective: Move with WASD (W=forward, A=left, S=down, D=right).
* First-Person Perspective: Turn the camera with the arrow keys.
* Overhead Orthogonal or Overhead Perspective: Spin the scene with the arrow keys.

## Time taken
According to my README, I spent anywhere from 32 to 42 hours getting my normal maps to work. At the time of the review, I had spent 40 to 50 hours on the project, with a partial bench making up the work after the normal maps were completed.

At the time of the final turn-in, I have about 56 to 66 hours total, having worked 15.65 hours since the review assignment.
