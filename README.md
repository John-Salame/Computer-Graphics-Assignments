# Homework 4: Projections
John Salame
CSCI 5229
Due 10/2/22 (originally 9/29/22)

## Cool View
For the best view of the scene, check "Nice View.png"  
I took the image because I did not have my coordinate debug on when I found the view.  
This is the view you enter by default when you enter first-person mode. It's not exact, but it's close enough.

## Controls
* Press M (M for mode) to change from Orthogonal to Perspective to First Person.
* Press 0 (zero) to reset the scene.
* First-Person Perspective: Move with WASD (W=forward, A=left, S=down, D=right).
* First-Person Perspective: Turn the camera with the arrow keys.
* Overhead Orthogonal or Overhead Perspective: Spin the scene with the arrow keys.

## Time taken
I spent 15.5 hours in total on Homework 4. Check version_log.txt for a full overview.
