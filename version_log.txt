 * CSCI 5229 Computer Graphics
 * Homework 3 - 3D Scene
 * Due 9/22/22
 * Work log and version log:
 *   Version 1 (untracked) 10/21/22 10:00 PM - 10/22/22 1:30 AM = 3.5 hr
 *     Got the shaft of the candy cane, but missing the last quad; not sure why
 *       Answer: The quad was not missing; the cylinder wall was complete. The missing part was one pie slice of the base circle.
 *     Attempted to do the hook but realized I still don't know exactly how coordinates and transforms work
 *     This is as far as I get without looking at examples
 *   Version 2 (tracked) 10/22/22 3:30 PM - 4:24 PM = 0.9 hr
 *     Remembered to enable Z-Buffer, fixed the weird rendering of the cylinder when I should have seen the base but could not.
 *     Remembered to do the triangle fan at <=360 degrees (I had <360, which looked like Pac-Man instead of a circle).
 *     Figured out which axis I actually need to rotate the hook around (y-axis, not z-axis).
 *     I still need to get the candy cane hook in the correct location. Right now it is on top of the hook's axis of rotation instead of on top of the straight part of the cane. I need to maybe use homogeneous coordinates in order to rotate the (-hookRad, 0, 0) vector around the origin.
 *   Version 3 (tracked) 10/22/22 4:24 PM - 5:00 PM = 0.6 hr
 *     Got the candy cane hook working (but the top of the hook curve is disjoint because the cylinders are too short. I may make the hook mathematically later, with variable section lengths depending on the distance of the point from the center of the hook sweep curve). 
 *     I still do not specify the location and rotation of a candy cane as parameters. If I do this, it should make positioning things in the scene easier.
 *    Version 4 (tracked) 10/22/22 8:30 PM - 11:00 PM = 2.5 hr
 *      I have one smoooooth candy cane!
 *      I made a proof on a whiteboard for how long to make the secant line and in what direction, for perfectly connecting hook segments.
 *      The proof is hookProof.JPG.
 *      I still do not have parameters in the candy cane for physical placement, but I am happy with what I have.
 *      I think my object is sufficiently complicated, if you look at the equation I came up with to generate the hook.
 *    Version 5 (tracked)
 *      Add README.md
 * Time Taken:
 *  I have taken 7.5 hours in total to create my candy canes.  
 *  In the future, I may make snowflakes. 
 *  My idea for a final project is to make a metallic park bench under a lamp with some piles of snow around, snowflakes falling, and candy canes planted in the snow, like a sort of winter fantasy.

 * Homework 4 - Projections
 * Due 10/2/22 (originally due 9/29/22)
 * Work log and version log:
 *   Fri, 9/30/22 - 2 hr
 *     Reread my notes and make a plan
 *   Version 0 Sat, 10/1/22 2:06 PM - 1 hr
 *     Convert HW3 files to HW4 files
 *   Version 1 Sat, 10/1/22 2:06 PM - 6:44 PM = 4.5 hr
 *     Very simple perspective projection using formula from example 9
 *   Version 2 Sun, 10/2/22 1:45 PM - 3:15 PM = 1.5 hr
 *     Switching between modes
 *   Version 3 Sun, 10/2/22 3:15 PM - 4:30 PM = 1.25 hr
 *     Turning the head is weird. Instead of turning the head around the real y-axis, it turned it around the up axis, which felt unnatural as it caused the head to turn in a rising and falling arc.
 *   Version 4 Sun, 10/2/22 4:30 PM = 5:00 PM = 0.5 hr
 *     Got head turning correct
 *   Version 5 Sun, 10/2/22 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM = 1 hr
 *     First-person completed. Got walking working.
 *   Version 6 Sun, 10/2/22 6:00 PM - 7:15 PM = 1.25 hr
 *     Got reshape working (previously had a bug with my transforms happening twice each time I resized the window)
 *     Nicer starting point for first-person mode
 *   Version 7 Sun, 10/2/22 7:15 PM - 8:15 PM = 1 hr
 *     Implemented a scene reset button (button 0)
 *     Started implementing snow mound
 *   Version 8 Sun, 10/2/22 8:15 PM - 9:45 PM = 1.5 hr
 *     I finalized my scene and took a nice screenshot!

 * Homework 5 - Lighting
 * Due 10/6/22, extended to Sun, 10/9/22
 * Revisions and work log:
 *   Version 0 Tues, 10/4/22
 *     Change mentions of HW4 to HW5
 *   Version 1 Wed, 10/5/22 3 hr
 *     Calculated all my normals, but the lighting does not work (it is always showing on the same side of the prefab, as if the light is always the same position relative to every object as I create it (instead of sitting in a global position).
 *   Version 2 Thurs, 10/6/22 (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM) = 3 hr
 *     I moved the light around and found that the snow piles are ok and the candy canes are the problem. It seems like I am lighting the opposite side.
 *   Version 3 Thurs, 10/6/22 (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM, 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM, 7:30 PM - 8:00 PM) = 3 hr
 *     Separate the logic into multiple files so I can easily switch scenes and have less clutter in my main file.
 *   Version 4 Fri, 10/7/22 (8:00 AM - 8:30 AM, 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM - 9:30 PM) = 6 hr
 *     Logic for changing scenes and controlling the light
 *     Fixed the lighting on rotated objects (I had a bug because I never left the projection matrix in my Project() function)
 *     Fixed the normal vectors on the candy cane hook segment (no longer flat shading)
 *     Updated instructions on README
 *   Version 5 Fri, 10/7/22 (11:00 PM - 1:45 AM) = 2.75 hr
 *     Added day and night cycle to scene 0.
 *     Also, lots of fine-tuning and choosing a good initial position to watch the sunrise and sunset.
 *   Version 6 Sun, 10/9/22 (12:30 PM) = 0 hr
 *     Fix compilation on Mac (fixed a linking error with the ordering of the files).
 *     Fixed day/night bug when rewinding time at night (it wasn't switching to day).
 *     Added option to enable or disable axes.
 *     Removed axes by default so the scene looks nicer.
 *     Put yourself in orthogonal mode when viewing singular objects.

 * Revisions and work log:
 *   Version 1 Mon, 12:00 PM - 6:30 PM ? (4 to 6 hours of work)
 *     Created textures for snow and for the end of the candy cane.
 *     I created the textures in GIMP since I could not find any good textures in bmp format.
 *   Version 2 Tues, 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM = 1 hr
 *     Add grass texture and resubmit

 *     Wed. 11/23/22 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM (1 hr)
 *     Fix the names of things to say Final Project
 *     Begin making the normal map creator in Python
 *   Version 1 (4 hr)
 *     Wed. 11/23/22 9:00 PM - Thurs 11/24/22 1:00 AM (4 hr)
 *     I created a script to produce a normal map for an image.
 *     So far, it only creates the X component of the normal map.
 *     The Y component is 128, and the Z component is 255.
 *   Version 2 (5.75 hr)
 *     Thurs. 11/24/22 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM = 1.5 hr Study Example 25
 *     Thurs. 11/24/22 1:30 PM - 3:15 PM = 1.75 hr Fix Winding
 *       Still unsure if the winding on the ball is correct. I might just disable culling when I draw it.
 *     Fri. 11/25/22 7:40 AM - 9:40 AM = 2 hr attempt to mimic standard pipeline with two LightPos
 *     Fri. 11/25/22 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM = 0.5 hr - Shader imitating standard pipeline works!
 *   Version 3 (1 hr)
 *     Fri. 11/25/22 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 1 hr Per-Pixel Lighting With Multiple Lights
 *   Version 4 (3.5 hr)
 *     Fri. 11/25/22 3:50 PM - 7:20 PM = 3.5 hr get normal maps working on flat surfaces (looks more like bumps than cuts though)
 *   Version 5 (3.5 hr)
 *     Fri. 11/25/22 8:45 PM - Sat. 12/26/22 12:15 AM = 3.5 hr Read and prepare for vertex attribute

 *     Mon. 11/28/22 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM = 0.5 hr Some debugging of normal map on curved surface
 *     Mon. 11/28/22 7:00 PM - 7:42 PM = 0.7 hr troubleshooting and fixing normal map on snow pile (I had forgotten to set the program like an idiot!)
 *     Mon. 11/28/22 7:42 PM - 9:42 PM = 2 hr get normal map on part of candy cane (not worth it, the effect is much too subtle)
 *   Version 7 (7.5 hours)
 *     Tues. 11/29/22 9:00 PM - Wed. 11/30/22 4:30 AM = 7.5 hr get wooden bench working
 *       Geometry, textures, normal maps; 256 lines of code in 7.5 hours
 *       The bench is still incomplete and the only part I focused on was the seat. Everything else is awful.
 *   Version 7.5 (0.4 hours)
 *     Wed. 11/30/22 4:30 AM - 4:51 AM = 0.4 hours updating README
 *   Version 8 (0.7 hours) (Final version for review assignment)
 *     Wed. 11/30/22 4:51 AM - 5:33 AM = 0.7 hr fix but in normal map generator (Python)
 *       I had an inbalanced kernel and that made everything wonky. I noticed the one incorrect value and changed it.
 *       I decided to keep the snow normal maps from the bugged version because I like the wonky melty look compared to the "correct" rigid version.
 *   Version 9 (0 hr)
 *     Fri. 12/2/22 1:20 PM change names to "final" instead of "project"
 *   Version 10 (3.35 hr)
 *     Sat. 12/3/22 8:30 AM - 10:14 AM = 1.75 hr attempt to make the front panel of the butt slat (I'm getting the textures wrong)
 *     Sat. 12/3/22 10:14 AM - 11:08 AM = 0.9 hr I got the front texture to look good, but I can't make extra grains of wood look good on the other side
 *     Mon. 12/5/22 11:20 PM - Tues. 12/6/22 12:04 AM = 0.7 hr get bench slats working correctly (though the underside's cracks in the wood look weird and wrong unlike the top)
 *   Version 11 (8.5 hr)
 *     Tues. 12/6/22 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM = 3 hr plan for bench back and try to fix normal map on left fillet
 *     Tues. 12/6/22 8:00 PM - 10:15 PM = 2.25 hr 
 *       Potentially fix base plate error (it was pulling a uniform variable index from the wrong shader)
 *       Fix the left fillet rendering (but lose the most prominent non-white scratches/splits visually in the process)
 *       Fix the rendering of the fillet front face
 *     Tues. 12/6/22 10:15 PM - Wed. 12/7/22 1:30 AM = 3.25 hr back rest and "metal rod" connecters
 *       I used candy canes in place of metal rods for testing, but I think I will continue to use candy canes instead of switching to metal.
 *   Version 12 (1.8 hr)
 *     Wed. 12/7/22 1:30 AM - 3:18 AM = 1.8 hr bench legs completed
 *   Version 13 (2 hr) (Final version!)
 *     Wed 12/7/22 3:18 AM - 5:18 AM = 2 hr Blizzard overlay
 *       I also attempted to make the bench fancier by adding more to the sides, but I didn't get the math right and I scrapped it.
